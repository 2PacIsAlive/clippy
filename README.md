## About
Clippy is a bot designed to play the artificial intelligence game [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html).

It plays the game without using cheats, similar to how a human would
after studying the game and learning how to play it. That being said,
Clippy definitely clicks faster than you do! It performs multiple
actions on each execution of the browser's javascript event loop.
On my laptop, that shakes out to around 12000 to 120000 actions per minute.

## Strategy

### Phase 1

### Phase 2

#### Bootstrapping from low clip count
If Clippy gets lucky and absolutely dominates the stock market in the
previous phase, it is able enter the second phase with the minimum number
of clips required to get off the ground. 

#### Swarm Computing

### Phase 3
